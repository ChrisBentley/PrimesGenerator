# PrimesGenerator
Generates a multiplication table of x prime numbers.


Running the Primes Generator:

	$ Open the file `index.html` in your browser of choice

Running the tests:

	$ Open the file `tests/browser.html` in your browser of choice


Known Issues:

The drawing the table of prime numbers on the site can be very slow when the number of primes is high. The primes are still generated quickly, however the rendering of the table is what takes time.


What I'm pleased with:

I've happy with the prime number generation algorithm. I also feel that the test coverage is clear and succinct for the task.


Future Improvements with more time:

I would improve the rendering of the table on the webpage as it is currently quite slow and can sometimes cause the browser to crash if a high enough number of primes is used. I would also make the page look more visually pleasing.
